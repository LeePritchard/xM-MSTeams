# Pre-Requisites
* Microsoft Teams bot appID and password 
	* This requires you to sign up for an msbot account here (https://dev.botframework.com)
	* Create a bot by going to here (https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new)
* A place to host a NodeJS application
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [ExampleCommPlan.zip](ExampleCommPlan.zip) - This is an example comm plan to help get started. 

# How it works
Once this is setup then you can install the application into MS Teams, when a message gets sent to the bot the message gets processed by the NodeJS application and makes the required calls to xMatters and returns a response message.

# Installation
Details of the installation go here. 

## xMatters set up

1. Import a communication plan (link: http://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/xmodwelcome/communicationplanbuilder/exportcommplan.htm)

2. Create the "MSTeams" Endpoint and add the url for the hosted bot.

3. Create the "MSTeams path" Constant and add the value "/api/response".


## Bot set up

1. Replace all instances of "********-****-****-****-************" with your microsoftAppId.

```
.env:
line 3

manifest.json:
line 5,
line 42,
line 76

default.json:
line 3

```

2. Replace all instances of "-----------------------" with your microsoftAppPassword.

```
.env:
line 4

/config/default.json:
line 4

```

3. Replace all instances of "https://xmatters-url.com" with your xMatters URL.

```

/config/default.json:
line 7

```

4. Add your xMatters rest username and password to /config/default.json

5. update the integration codes in /config/default.json to match the inbound integrations in your xMatters instance.

```
Example:

https://xmatters-url.com/api/integration/1/functions/d0b41e9a-dc8b-4620-93ec-03e96f5cabf8/triggers

Would be "d0b41e9a-dc8b-4620-93ec-03e96f5cabf8"

```

6. Generate the MSTeams installation file by running "gulp" in the route directory.

7. Host the files in a location and run using the following commands:

```

npm install
npm start

```



## MS Teams set up

1. Install the application produced in the previous step.

2. Done.
